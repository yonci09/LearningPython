""" Write a program that iterates over the integers 1 through 50 using a loop.
However, for numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print “FizzBuzz” in the output. 
For example, 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5, so instead of printing 15, print "FizzBuzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of 3 but not 5 (such as 42) print “Fizz” instead of the number. 
For the numbers that are multiples of 5 but not 3 (such as 20) print “Buzz” instead of the number.
All of the integers which are not multiples of 3 or 5 should just be printed as themselves. """
